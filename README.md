# Senku2D
Senku2D is a Simple 2D Physics Engine that is based on "Cyclone" from the book 
"Game Physics Engine Development" by Ian Millington. The Engine can perform Collision Detection, Collision Response
and Rigid Body Dynamics. 
<br></br>It offers: 
- Fast Broad Phase Collision Detection using Uniform Hashed Grids.
- A Collision Shape Solver for Boxes, Triangles and Circles.
- A Physics Integrator for Rigid Body Dynamics.
- World Queries using Raycasts and AABB Casts.
- Collision Filtering.
